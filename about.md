Sometimes I feel like [Winston Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Smith) in [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) novel dealing with software world. Despite majority acceptance, I find it hard to accept few of well known software paradigms are of any help toward better software.

Among other things software development and maintenance has turned unnecessarily complex. The only way to fight this complexity is to introduce simpler solutions. 

What is best said by [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Friedrich_Nietzsche) "He who fights monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster." applies here. The way to fight complexity can easily turn into immature low quality software that ends up being more complex than the original one. The key is to have a right level of abstraction in our methodology, modeling and tools.

Today's software runs on ultra advanced hardware. A capacity rarely fully utilized. Software is being developed on top of layers of older software because we're afraid to change it ultimately because we find it too complex to understand and build software.

This is a classic blog about all things interesting and helpful plus my findings toward simpler software. Hope you find it useful. I'm based in Sydney Australia working as a consultant at [Qantas Airlines](http://www.qantas.com).
