Sometimes I feel like [Winston Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Smith) in [1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) novel dealing with software world. Despite majority acceptance I find it hard to accept few of well known software paradigms are of any help toward better software.

Among other things software development and maintenance has turned unnecessarily complex. The only way to fight this complexity is to introduce simpler solutions. 

What is best said by [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Friedrich_Nietzsche) "He who fights monsters should see to it that he himself does not become a monster." applies here. The way to fight complexity can easily turn into immature, underestimated, low quality software that ends up being more complex than the original one. The key is to have a right level of abstraction in our methodology, modeling and tools.

Today's software runs on ultra advanced hardware. A capacity rarely fully utilized. Software is being developed on top of layers of older software because we're afraid to change it ultimately because we find it too complex to understand and build software. 

I'm based in Sydney Australia working as a consultant at [Qantas Airlines](http://www.qantas.com). Before that as SSO systems specialist at [Telstra](https://www.telstra.com.au).

Named one of the [top 25 most influential people in government and technology](http://fedscoop.com/top-federal-it-and-tech-folks-under-40/) and Fed 50's Disruptor of the Year, described by the US Chief Technology Officer as one of "the baddest of the badass innovators," and winner of the Open Source People's Choice Award, Ben Balter is the Government Evangelist at [GitHub](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_T3XEgXl14) — the world's largest software development network — where he leads the efforts to encourage adoption of open source philosophies, making all levels of government better, one repository at a time.

Previously, Ben was a member of the inaugural class of Presidential Innovation Fellows where he served as entrepreneur in residence reimagining the role of technology in brokering the relationship between citizens and government. Before that, he was a Fellow in the Office of the US Chief Information Officer within the Executive Office of the President where he was instrumental in drafting the President's Digital Strategy and Open Data Policy, on the SoftWare Automation and Technology (SWAT) Team, the White House’s first and only agile development team, and as a [New Media Fellow](http://reboot.fcc.gov/blog/?authorId=593709), in the Federal Communications Commission's Office of the Managing Director where he played a central role in shaping the agency's reimagined web presence. His paper, [Towards a More Agile Government](http://ben.balter.com/2011/11/29/towards-a-more-agile-government/) was published in the Public Contract Law Journal, arguing that Federal IT Procurement should be more amenable to modern, agile development methods.

As an attorney passionate about the disruptive potential of technology, Ben holds a J.D. and an M.B.A. from the George Washington University and is a member of the DC Bar. When not trying to change the world, he enjoys tackling otherwise-impossible challenges to sharing information using nothing more than duct tape, version control, and occasionally a pack of bubblegum.
