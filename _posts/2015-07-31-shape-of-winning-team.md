The need to feel important is an essential part of our soul. Probably the most powerful demand in humankind. This is what differs us from animals. We all want to play a key role and be recognised.

This rule applies when shaping up a successful team. If team members feel their importance isn't well recognised they will eventually loose momentum, feel dismissed, leaving the team in a bitter wilderness. 

Todays companies try their best to become customer centric. Considering customers requirement and their feedback the pointing needle toward strategic decisions. Take [NPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) as an example. It becomes so important that even employees KPI and bonus depends on how they satisfied the customers. 

Obviously blindly following customer’s feedback can cause lose of innovation in long runs. There should be a fine balance between vision and customer feedback in shaping the strategic plan. Say 70% vision vs 30% customer and customers share growing as company becomes mature. 

But in its essence being customer centric is great. Customers also feel important and emotionally satisfied when they are asked for their opinion and see those inputs really taking effect in next coming decisions.

### Employee-Happy First, Customer-Happy Next ###
While customers have their role, employees are actually the workforce implementing all those ideas. Don't expect customer-happy company without having employee-happy in place. An unhappy employee will rarely do its best to satisfy your customers. Sometimes even leave ranting about hidden issues of the product and advantages of competitors. 

For agile teams that work together for months or years, the on and off input of appreciation isn't simply enough. What I found out for a team to be self-organizing we need a designated role for all members plus personal and public recognition. 

The shape of the most teams I've seen is something like this:

While is not always not a inappropriate shapes, especially for learning team, it hardly can maintain a long running happy team. 

To maintain a growing team, even member needs to feel important. Take soccer as an example. Sure there might be super star players, other also have their key role. Goal keeper, defenders, midfielders, wings and forwards. Remove anyone of them and the team will loose miserably. Each player have its own role and they know the performance of every individual can lead to a glorious win or drastic lose. They have different salary package. But that’s rarely a big deal. The most important wage is the ego. Pocket comes next. 

In large teams, it’s harder to maintain this ownership. That’s why scrum insist on teams of 6 people or so. In a small team, importance of people is crystal clear.

On the other hand a fully flat team can lead to chaos. People can have different and often conflicting ideas of how to solve a problem or implement a requirement. Even each individual gets better at understanding of domain and solutions over time and may disregard his own ideas over time. 

### Think of SMEs ###
What I found is to replace a single leader with multiple Subject Matter Expert (SME)s. Keep one leader but make him a servant leader. So the team looks more or less like this:

![Flat Team](http://www.jeremyjarrell.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/paper-doll-team-770x513.jpg){: .aligncenter}


Have SMEs and ask them to share their knowledge. Even an intern can be a leading SME in its field. If he/she’s is really newbie, make it SME of logistics. To prints scrum board and stationary. Give people role and let them feel important.  

In a software domain your SMEs could of of any functional or nonfunctional topics. Such as but not limited to:

- Performance and Tuning
- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- DevOps an Automation
- Change Management 
- Documentation and Wiki
- Code Quality 
- Trending Technologies
- Solution and Domain Architecture 
- Stationary 
- Team Planning and Events 
- Organization Work-flow 
- Internship On-boarding 
- Customer Negotiation and Marketing 

Obviously SME doesn’t mean there is only one person with that knowledge. But there is one person who’s the best of knowledge of the topic. What I noticed is that making people SME actually promotes knowledge share. Once a person realises he’s the go-to person for a topic, he feels no worries of sharing. The better people learn is a sign he’s damn good as his job.

In ideal situation every team member has a set of SMEs assigned to him. If that’s not the case, work toward it. A good way to start is to implicitly challenge people against their own ego. They may feel uncomfortable to take something new on. They may feel "or I’m not supposed to do this". Give them courage to try and make mistake and find their way through. As always said "fake it till you make it".
 
### Food for Thought ###
The other food, is food for thought. People are different but to my observation if normally comes third for most people; after ego and pocket. Youngsters prefer to learn, oldsters tend to reuse their knowledge to get better pay. By default most people love to explore and learn new things. Even if they don’t show it off. Some have buried this gift for such a long time, they have almost forgot it. Once opportunity rises, it wakes up. If you have such people in the team, feed them. Let them learn. If you don’t, encourage them to become a learner.

There is slight risk here. As a servant leader, you need to let people learn and try new things but not always on top of your working product. Software is relatively a young industry. There are new things all the time. If you want to try every new trend or tool on top of the product in the sake of learning it, in no time you product turns into an spaghetti. 

Things cat easily get tricking once you decide to implement a complex problem on top of a new paradigm. The "Hello World!" example might be far too simple to really present the capabilities or challenges of it. 

<!--
To help with this, I’d suggest two things. First is to let team pick up and use new trends every now of then if there is an expansion or new products. Second is the regular brown bag or knowledge sharing sessions. Give them chance to learn and play in a sandbox rather than in a working product. 
-->

Be aware than even a successful working products has to keep up with the trends every now and then. If the product is too legacy, it turn out to be hard to find resources. And knowledgeable people may also leave for the sake of expressing new things. A good practice for legacy software is to ask team to try and see how they can port the product into cloud and enter the SaaS market. They’ll love to do so. Or how to build a modern web application on top of it.

### Deal with Hard-to-Deal People ###
Last comes the "hard to deal with" people. Even will all the joy, celebration and happiness in the team, there are ranting grumpy people everywhere. Don't be surprised if those grumpy guys are the key people in your team.
Approach them. Have one to one meetings. Assure them you understand their importance and role. Ask them to help others. Stereotypes such a "take a fun break" are there but I doubt they came handy all times. What really helps here is a bit of people skills and psychology. Learn body language. Try to see what you don’t see. Help them to help themselves.

If there is a debate in the team, try to understand both sides and resolve them before spreading and impacting all team. Trust people with more skills and longer expertise. Do not try to take one side only because that person is friendlier to you or what he says seems more logical in the first glance. A team leader may not always have the best judgment on all domain. Experience and knowledge is the one you trust. If your SME says, we need to do it this way, do it. Trust him and gain his trust back. 

If none works out, eliminate them. "talent wins games. teamwork wins championship."
