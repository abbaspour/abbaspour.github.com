As far as I remember, I have always been a fan of writing. Having record of almost every single 
day of my life since teenager.

As a matter of fact, have a [technical](http://aminsblog.wordpress.com/) and [personal](http://aminslife.wordpress.com/) 
blogs on WordPress, but all this hassle of getting something in mind into a proper post in WordPress kind of 
prevented me from being active there.

To be fair, WordPress is great if you are blogging not so technical. This doesn't worked for me. 
Almost every time I write a post it has bits and pieces of code/scripts and making it look pretty sometimes took me hours and 
not so happy at the end.

For long time, was hopping to find a blogging engine/site to support simple markdown so 
I can forget about all L&F and just focus on what's in my mind. And now feel like this dream 
has come true.

[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is simply the exact thing I was looking for. Plus I found a [soulmate's blog](http://www.perkin.org.uk/)
as a template and started my own on bitbucket. [Source code](http://www.bitbucket.org/amin/weblog) is also hosted on there.

Having said this, have a lot to share. Stay tuned.
